The name of the folder implies how the model was trained, for example:

- `4-2-2` means the first model (always `idle`) was trained on data of 4 channels, the second model (always `scroll`) was trained on data of 2 channels, and the third model (always `zoom`) was trained on data of 2 channels.
- `422-2` means the model has the same specification as the previous one mentioned before, and is the second one trained.
